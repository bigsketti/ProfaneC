ProfaneC, the most evil of the C's and a direct rival to Terry Davis's HolyC used to create TempleOS. 
ProfaneC is meant to have similar syntax to good ol plain ol C but slightly more evil and a whole lot less useful.
Currently it is just a lexer but I will continue development on it over time until I deem it finished. 
This is just a fun project to teach my how programming languages and compilers work at a deeper level while
also being a means of improving my programming skills. I plan to implement quality of life detriments such as,
arrays beginning index being 1, as many implicit type conversions as possible (who doesn't love ambiguity), 
compiler errors and warnings made to ruin your day, and so much more to make your programming experience as
evil as possible!

This will not be the next big language, I am a first year college student that does not have the time, knowledge, 
or resources to develope a full fledged functional language that compiles to machine code and has unique enough 
features to have a place in the real world. This is simply a fun project to melt my brain on for a while.
